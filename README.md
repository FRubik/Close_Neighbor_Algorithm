# Close Neighbor Algorithm
Close neighbour algorithm for designing cellular manufacturing systems

Close Neighbor Algotirhm is a matrix organization method to optimize the cellular arrangement of factories, it was developed by Boe and Cheng and published in 1991 in the paper `A close neighbor algorithm for designing cellular manufacturing systems`.

The idea of the technique is to organize a matrix in order to group machines and products (for more details, see the paper).

After understanding how the technique works, I wrote an algorithm in Jupyter to solve this optimization problem, I'll see if I can improve the algorithm someday, but for a first version, I think it's fine.
